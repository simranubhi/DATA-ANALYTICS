                                                                     ---- WEEK 2 (DAY-1) ----
Topics Covered: - Working with Built-in Datasets
                - Data Exploration
                - Basic Statistics in R

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A dataset is a structured collection of data, often presented in rows and columns (like a spreadsheet or a table), which can be used for analysis, 
visualization, or modeling in R.
In simple terms, a dataset is data you work with — it could be information about students, cars, sales, weather, or any other real-world subject.

R provides a wide range of built-in datasets that are extremely useful for practice and experimentation. Using the data() function, we viewed all available 
datasets across installed packages and even checked how many datasets exist within the base datasets package. Two widely used datasets — AirPassengers and iris — 
were examined in depth. AirPassengers, which contains monthly airline passenger counts from 1949 to 1960, gave us a glimpse into time series data. On the other hand, 
the iris dataset introduced us to working with structured tabular data (data frames) representing flower measurements across species. We learned how to assign datasets
to variables, check dimensions, view column names, and access specific data columns. Through functions like summary(), sort(), min(), max(), and mean(), we performed 
basic statistical analysis to understand the spread and behavior of numeric data. We also identified key values such as the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and even 
derived the mode using a frequency table approach. This session laid the foundation for understanding how to inspect and interpret datasets in R, preparing us for future 
tasks like cleaning, transforming, and analyzing more complex real-world data.

1. Accessing Built-in Datasets in R
- R comes with many pre-loaded datasets useful for practice and learning. These datasets are part of the datasets package, which is installed by default with R.

--- Code ---
data()
data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))
all.datasets <- data(package = "datasets")$results[, "Item"]
length(all.datasets)

Concepts Covered:
- Viewing all available datasets
- Counting the number of built-in datasets
- Loading specific datasets for analysis

-----------------------------------------------

2. Exploring the AirPassengers Dataset (Time Series)
The AirPassengers dataset contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. It’s a classic time series dataset.

--- Code ---
?AirPassengers
abc = AirPassengers
dim(AirPassengers)

Concepts Covered:
- Accessing help/documentation using ?
- Assigning a dataset to a variable
- Checking dataset structure using dim()

-------------------------------------------------

3. Exploring the iris Dataset (Data Frame)
The iris dataset contains 150 rows and 5 columns of data about iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species.

--- Code ---
?iris
abc = iris
dim(abc)
names(abc)
rownames(abc)

Concepts Covered:
- Dataset exploration: dimensions, column names, row names
- Understanding data structure
- Assigning datasets to variables

-------------------------------------------------

4. Accessing Columns and Data Values
We can access a specific column in a data frame using the $ operator. For example, abc$Sepal.Length returns all values of the Sepal Length column.

--- Code ---
abc$Sepal.Length
sort(abc$Sepal.Length)
summary(abc)

Concepts Covered:
- Extracting a column using $
- Sorting data in ascending order
- Getting summary statistics like min, max, median, and quartiles

--------------------------------------------------

5. Descriptive Statistics
You can calculate statistical values like min, max, mean, median, and mode for numeric columns.

--- Code ---
min(sort(abc$Sepal.Length))
max(sort(abc$Sepal.Length))
which.max(abc$Sepal.Length)
which.min(abc$Sepal.Length)
min(abc$Sepal.Length)
max(abc$Sepal.Length)
mean(abc$Sepal.Length)
median(abc$Sepal.Length)

Concepts Covered:
- Finding minimum and maximum values
- Identifying the row index of min/max using which.min() and which.max()
- Calculating mean and median

----------------------------------------------------

6. Finding the Mode (Most Frequent Value)
R does not have a direct built-in mode() function for numeric vectors. We can use a combination of table(), sort(), and names() to find the most frequent value.

--- Code ---
names(sort(-table(abc$Sepal.Length)))  # mode

Concepts Covered:
- Creating a frequency table using table()
- Sorting frequencies in descending order
- Extracting the value with the highest frequency (mode)


                                                                       ----------------------------------------------
