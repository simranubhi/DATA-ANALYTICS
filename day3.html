-- DATA STRUCTURES IN R --
Data structures in R help organize data for analysis. They can be simple, holding only one type of data, or complex, supporting diverse data types. 
These data structures are tailored to the specific needs that arise during data-driven projects. The primary data structures in R are vectors, lists, matrices, arrays, factors, and data frames.

1. Vectors
Vectors are the simplest form of data structure in R. They are a collection of elements of the same type, such as numeric, character, or logical.
R is designed to work well with vectors and is specially designed to work with what are called vectorized operations. 
This means you can apply a function to a vector without needing to loop through its elements explicitly.
For example, adding two vectors together adds corresponding elements in a faster and more concise way than doing so element-wise through loops.

Key Points:
- R is inherently vectorized, meaning operations on vectors are applied element-wise without explicit loops.
- Vectors can be created using the c() function.

Syntax:
numeric_vector <- c(10, 20, 30)
character_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

Accessing Elements:
vector[1] → First element
vector[c(1, 3)] → Multiple elements

Practical Use:
Vectors are ideal for storing sequences like marks, temperature readings, or categorical survey results (as factors).


2. Matrices
Matrices are two-dimensional data structures that contain elements of the same data type. 
They are commonly used in linear algebra, image processing, and statistics.

Key Points:
- Created using the matrix() function.
- Elements are filled column-wise by default.
- Operations like addition, multiplication, etc., are applied element-wise unless specified otherwise.

Syntax:
my_matrix <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

Access:
my_matrix[1,2] → Element at row 1, column 2
my_matrix[2,] → Entire 2nd row
my_matrix[,3] → Entire 3rd column

Operations:
my_matrix + another_matrix   # Element-wise addition
my_matrix * another_matrix   # Element-wise multiplication

length(hello)        # counts total elements

# Nested for loop to print each element
num <- matrix(c(10, 20, 30, 40), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
for (rows in 1:nrow(num)) {
  for (columns in 1:ncol(num)) {
    print(num[rows, columns])
  }
}

# Sum of all matrix elements
total_sum <- sum(num)
print(paste("Total sum:", total_sum))


3.  ARRAYS
Arrays are multi-dimensional extensions of matrices and can have more than two dimensions.
They are used for storing large structured data — such as spatial, temporal, or image-based datasets.

Key Points:
- Created using the array() function.
- Dimensions are specified using the dim = c() argument.

Syntax:
my_array <- array(1:8, dim = c(2, 2, 2))
This creates a 3D array with 2 rows, 2 columns, and 2 layers.

arr <- c(1:9)                      # simple vector
arr
thisarray <- c(1:10)              
multiarray <- array(thisarray, dim = c(4, 3, 2))   # 3D array: 4 rows, 3 columns, 2 layers
multiarray[c(1), , 1]             # access 1st row from 1st layer
dim(multiarray)                   # returns the dimensions

Use Case:
Arrays are especially useful in simulations, environmental data modeling, and scientific computations.


5. LISTS
Lists are flexible data structures that can store a mix of different types of elements — including vectors, matrices, data frames, or even other lists.

Key Points:
- Created using the list() function.
- Unlike vectors or matrices, lists can hold elements of different lengths and types.

Useful for organizing complex outputs (like results from a statistical model).

Syntax:
my_list <- list(name = "DataCamp", year = 2024, scores = c(80, 90, 85), active = TRUE)
Accessing Elements:
my_list[[3]] → Access by position

my_list$name → Access by name

Use Case:
Lists are used to return complex outputs in machine learning models, Shiny apps, and nested data reports.

5. FACTORS
Factors are categorical variables that represent data with a limited number of unique values (levels). 
They are essential for statistical modeling and plotting, where categorical distinction matters.

Key Points:
- Created using the factor() function.
- Factors can be ordered or unordered.
- Internally stored as integers with labels.
- Very useful in regression models, classification tasks, and grouping in plots.

Syntax:
gender <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
levels(gender) <- c("Female", "Male")    # Relabel levels
S
ummary Statistics:
summary(gender)    # Shows count of each category

Difference from Character:
Factors carry an extra attribute called levels which define their possible categories.
While characters are just strings, factors have structured meaning — crucial in plotting and analysis.

Use Case:
Useful in encoding gender, education levels, regions, product categories, etc.
