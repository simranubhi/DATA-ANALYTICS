    <h3>Topics Covered:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Linear and multiple regression for stress-strain and flow rate modeling</li>
      <li>Polynomial regression for non-linear trends</li>
      <li>Curve fitting in mechanical systems (e.g., fatigue analysis)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  
    <h3>What is Time Series Analysis?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Time Series Analysis is a method of analyzing data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals (like daily, monthly, or yearly).</li>
      <li>It helps to understand trends, seasonal effects, or make forecasts based on historical data.</li>
      <li>This technique is essential in engineering and manufacturing where machine readings are collected over time for quality monitoring.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Common Use Cases of Time Series:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Stock market prediction</li>
      <li>Sales forecasting</li>
      <li>Temperature and weather forecasting</li>
      <li>Power consumption tracking</li>
      <li>Website traffic monitoring</li>
      <li>Predictive maintenance in mechanical systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>CODE for Time Series Analysis in R:</h4>
    <pre>
# Install and load correct package
install.packages("forecast")      
library(forecast)
ts_data = ts(mtcars, frequency = 12, start = c(1999, 1))

# Training data
train_data = window(ts_data, start = c(1999, 1), end = c(2000, 12))
test_data = window(ts_data, start = c(2001, 1))

# Build and forecast ARIMA model
arima_model = forecast::auto.arima(train_data)
forecast_result = forecast::forecast(arima_model, h = 12)
summary(arima_model)
plot(forecast_result)
    </pre>
  </div>

  
    <h3>What is Regression?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Regression is a statistical technique that models and analyzes the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.</li>
      <li>In engineering and mechanical contexts, regression helps us model real-world physical systems using data collected through experiments or sensors.</li>
      <li>It aids in decision-making by identifying the influence of various input parameters on a specific output.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Linear and Multiple Regression </h4>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>
      Linear regression models the relationship between two variables using a straight line.<br>
      Multiple regression involves more than one independent variable.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong><br>
      Modeling the stress-strain relationship in a material under tension or compression.<br>
      Predicting fluid flow rate in a pipe based on diameter, pressure, and viscosity.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Real-Life Mechanical Example:</strong><br>
      In a mechanical lab, engineers apply force to a metal rod and measure how much it stretches. By applying linear regression to the stress-strain data, they can determine the material's Young’s Modulus.<br>
      Similarly, automotive engineers may use multiple regression to predict fuel efficiency based on speed, load, and tire pressure.
    </p>

    <h4>Polynomial Regression for Non-Linear Trends:</h4>
    <p>
      Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression that models non-linear relationships by introducing powers (x², x³, etc.) of the independent variable.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> When a simple straight-line model doesn’t fit the data well.<br>
      Ideal for material deformation, cooling curves, or motor efficiency curves.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Real-Life Mechanical Example:</strong> In a heat transfer experiment, the temperature drop of a heated metal plate over time shows a non-linear pattern. Polynomial regression helps model this decay more accurately.<br>
      Engineers can use this approach to design efficient cooling systems in thermal applications.
    </p>

    <h4>-- Curve Fitting in Mechanical Systems (e.g., Fatigue Analysis):</h4>
    <p>
      Curve fitting involves finding the best-fit function (linear or non-linear) that closely follows a set of data points.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Analyzing how a material fails over repeated cycles of stress (fatigue).<br>
      It is also useful in pump performance modeling, vibration analysis, and temperature decay functions.
    </p>
