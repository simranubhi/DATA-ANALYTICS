  <h1>Week 1 (DAY-1)</h1>
  <h2>Basics of Data Analytics</h2>
  <h3>30 June</h3>

  <h2>What is Data Analytics?</h2>
  <p>Data Analytics refers to the process of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, relationships, and insights. It helps individuals, businesses, and organizations make better decisions based on facts and evidence rather than intuition.</p>
  <p>Imagine a huge pile of raw data as a messy room. Data analytics is like cleaning, organizing, and arranging everything in the room so you can find exactly what you need — quickly and efficiently.</p>
  <p>In simple words, data analytics helps answer important questions like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What happened?</li>
    <li>Why did it happen?</li>
    <li>What is likely to happen in the future?</li>
    <li>What actions should we take?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The 4 Major Steps in Data Analytics:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering raw data from various sources like websites, databases, sensors, social media, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Removing errors, duplicates, or irrelevant information to make the data accurate.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Using statistical methods or programming tools (like R or Python) to analyze the data.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Presenting the results using graphs, charts, dashboards, and reports for easy understanding.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Types of Data Analytics</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Descriptive Analytics:</strong> Understand what has already happened. Example: Sales reports.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostic Analytics:</strong> Analyze why something happened. Example: Investigating drop in sales.</li>
    <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Forecast future outcomes. Example: Netflix recommendations.</li>
    <li><strong>Prescriptive Analytics:</strong> Suggest actions. Example: Best time to launch a sale.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Real-Life Uses of Data Analytics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Track outbreaks, manage resources, monitor recovery.</li>
    <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Personalize shopping, track sales trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Detect fraud, assess loan risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Monitor performance, adjust strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Predict traffic, optimize routes.</li>
    <li><strong>Sports:</strong> Analyze performance, improve training.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why is Data Analytics Important?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Helps businesses grow by making smarter decisions.</li>
    <li>Saves time and money by avoiding guesswork.</li>
    <li>Creates personalized experiences for customers.</li>
    <li>Drives innovation by revealing hidden patterns or opportunities.</li>
    <li>Makes our daily lives easier — from mobile apps to smart devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started with R</h2>
  <p>R is a powerful open-source programming language designed for statistical computing, data analysis, and visualization. It’s widely used due to its flexibility and large number of libraries.</p>

  <h3>What Can You Do with R?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean and transform messy datasets</li>
    <li>Perform statistical analysis</li>
    <li>Create beautiful graphs and visualizations</li>
    <li>Build predictive models</li>
    <li>Work with geospatial, time series, and text data</li>
    <li>Connect with databases, spreadsheets, and even websites</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is RStudio?</h3>
  <p>RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. Think of R as the engine and RStudio as the steering wheel and dashboard.</p>

  <h3>Why Use RStudio?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Easy-to-navigate interface</li>
    <li>Organized layout with multiple panels</li>
    <li>Autocomplete and syntax highlighting</li>
    <li>Integrated package management</li>
    <li>Easy access to documentation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How to Install R and RStudio</h3>
  <p><strong>Step 1: Install R</strong><br>
  Visit <a href="https://cran.r-project.org" target="_blank">https://cran.r-project.org</a><br>
  Choose your operating system and download R.<br>
  Follow setup instructions and use default settings.</p>

  <p><strong>Step 2: Install RStudio</strong><br>
